## **GraphQL Server Deep Dive**

This repo dives into the basic parts of a GraphQL server implementation. It also provides examples of a few tools and conventions that are important for teams to be aware of when building complex GraphQL APIs.



### **The Building Blocks of a GraphQL API**

- **Schema** ðŸ“ƒ
  
  A type system defined for your data. This acts as a contract for
  

- **Resolvers** ðŸšœ
  
  A set of functions defined for each type. These functions are called when types are requested and validated against the schema.

2. A quick look at how to manage a microservice or service oriented architecture

- Schema Stitching
- Apollo Federation example



## Getting started

1. Change `index.ts` file to point at your preferred schema object.  Comment out other schema imports. Or comment out `apolloServer` and uncomment `gateway` to explore [Schema Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/federation-spec/)

2. Run `yarn && yarn start` in root
